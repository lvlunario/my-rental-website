L&L Vacation Rentals Website

This project is the official website for L&L Vacation Rentals, showcasing curated properties in Maui, Hawaii, and Ilocos Norte, Philippines.

Project Goal:
To create a user-friendly website that allows potential guests to explore our properties, view details and photos, and seamlessly inquire about direct bookings or book through Airbnb.

Structure:
The site is divided into two main sections:

    Maui Vacation Rentals: Featuring our properties in Kihei and Maalaea.

    Philippines Transient Home: Highlighting our "Casa Deoasay" property which offers short-term stays, pool access, and function hall rentals.
